This project is developed in the context of the course "Image Audio and Video Multimedia" course, as part of the masters in Informatics Engineering in ISEP. The goal is to develop software that can handle these requirements.

* load an image from the disk
* save the edited image
* list all the file properties
* search for a specific color within the image
* count the number of pixels with a specific color
* crop the image
* zoom (50, 100, 200,300,400,500%)
* add a red, blue or green filter
* change the brightness
* change the contrast
* remove a certain color from the image (chromakey)
* history (undo, redo)
* image resize
* rotate image
* horizontal and vertical flip
* add text or another image to the composition
* invert colors
* change gamma
* crop the image in halves, or fourths
